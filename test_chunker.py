# Main Heading

This is the first paragraph with some content.



This is the second paragraph after excessive newlines.    It has    extra spaces.

## Sub Heading

Another paragraph under a sub-heading. This paragraph contains multiple sentences. Each sentence should be handled properly by the semantic chunker.

### Another Sub Heading

Final paragraph with some more content to test the chunking behavior.
